There's a whole bunch of different file formats on these servers and they're all identical. To prove your SSRF, please send your attacks in a way that attempt to read or write content to/from one of these servers in each network segment (Prod + Corp). The difference between each host within each category is just their geolocation, which in most circumstances does not matter what you target.  HTTPS is also enabled on these servers.\n\nProduction Network\n* banana.stand.ne1.prod.oath (banana.stand.ne1.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.gq1.prod.oath (banana.stand.gq1.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.bf1.prod.oath (banana.stand.bf1.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.bf2.prod.oath (banana.stand.bf2.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.sg3.prod.oath (banana.stand.sg3.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.ir2.prod.oath (banana.stand.ir2.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.tw1.prod.oath (banana.stand.tw1.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.tp2.prod.oath (banana.stand.tp2.yahoo.com)\n\nCorporate Network\n* banana.stand.corp.gq1.cic.oath (banana.stand.cgq1.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.corp.bf1.cic.oath (banana.stand.cbf1.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.corp.sg3.cic.oath (banana.stand.csg3.yahoo.com)\n* banana.stand.corp.ne1.cic.oath (banana.stand.cne1.yahoo.com)\n\nFiles to target take the filename format of `<extension>_###.<extension>`. For example: `txt_001.txt` and `zip_001.zip`. We've put up a bunch of different file formats that can be targeted for your testing needs.  \n\nFile types available include: \navi, bmp, css, csv, doc, docx, dtd, flv, gif, html, icns, ics, ico, jar, jpg, js, json, md, mkv, mov, mp3, mp4, odp, ods, odt, ogg, pdf, php, png, ppt, rss, svg, tiff, txt, wav, wmv, xls, xlsx, xml, xsl, zip\n\nWe’ve also set the 404 error page to show you that you’ve hit the bananastand and not just some other unknown host: `<html>...404 no bananas for you!...</html>`\n\n**When testing**, it would be super helpful if (along with the file you pull down) you try to fetch `http://<hostname>/hackerone-<username>` so that we can identify **your** activity in the logs more easily.\n\n**When submitting a report** (in addition to all the usual details) please make sure to:\n1. Attach a copy of the file you fetched.\n2. Include the timestamp you fetched the file.\n3. Note the SSRF server that you fetched the file from.\n\n---\n\n### The Fine Print\nIf you can’t hit these servers but can hit something else inside our network, you must provide a working POC and understand that we will individually evaluate impact of the host you tested with.\n\nWe reserve the right to award a $0 bounty for any SSRF (or similar) reports that are not able to touch these servers.\n\nAlso, we will periodically review the logs on these servers and may reach out to hackers that have hit the server but not submitted a report. If this happens, you will be eligible for **a maximum award of 10%** for the report.\n",

Vulnerabilities found from java-tron may impact the TRON blockchain network integrity, especially if valid against a Super Representative node - a node capable of producing blocks and collecting mining rewards.\n\n**What to look for:** The best way to look for vulnerabilities is running a java-tron node locally and starting experimenting with the APIs it exposes. There are multiple guides on https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron and https://developers.tron.network/docs that can help with the initial setup and API usage. We value these types of issues (but not limited to) with high priority:\n- 1) economically-feasible way to DDoS the TRON network\n- 2) disrupt the integrity of blockchain by sending malicious data to the network\n- 3) slow down network performance by sending crafted API requests to network nodes. Unless approved by a TRON team member, no proof-of-concepts should be carried out directly on the mainnet. Hacking machines that host TRON nodes is not a valid form of attack on the blockchain. Local PoC and mainnet attack estimation should be enough information for most reports.\n\n**What it runs on:** Anywhere an Oracle JVM (1.8) can run. However, we recommend an environment with at least 16 CPU cores for best results of syncing and communicating with the network.\n",

For example, the [demo](https://eslint.org/demo/) on `eslint.org` runs ESLint in the user's browser, with the source code and configuration specified in the URL hash. Some of our users also host services that can be used to lint untrusted code. An attack of this nature would likely indicate a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability on `eslint.org`, and similar vulnerabilities on other sites that run ESLint on user-supplied input.\n\nOther potential security vulnerabilities in ESLint are also in scope, but note that most aspects of ESLint are not security-sensitive. For example ESLint allows the user to load plugins and JavaScript config files, which are executed during a lint run. As a result, a malicious config file or plugin could compromise the user's system. However, we don't consider this to be an issue specific to ESLint; in general, it's important that a user doesn't run untrusted third-party code on a system.\n\nFor bugs in ESLint which don't have a security impact, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/new?template=BUG_REPORT.md) instead.",

We do not expect researchers to attempt to hack or attack Auth0 - the third-party identity provider/authentication service that the platform relies on, although any other potential issue in the authentication flow that is not specifically due to Auth0 is part of the scope.\n\nThe following issues are already known:\n• Platform is not optimised for high availability so far\n• A user shall not try to destruct his own account (Ex: modify his own data by making API calls in order to create an inconsistency)\n• Access token last for 24hours, which is too important and shall be reduced to 15 minutes soon\n• JWT blacklisting is not implemented for now\n* Registration links (and first connection codes) are still returned as part of user's data but are supposed to be removed soon\n\nThe following postman documentation outlines the purpose and how to use the API\nhttps://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5733481/SW7T8XSY?version=latest#2860d3d9-7b3a-4e37-b26d-cc1829a90e84\n\nThe platform is meant for 2 types of users: ISSUERs and INVESTORs.\nAn ISSUER can:\n - create, invite and on-board INVESTORs on the platform\n - create assets(Ethereum smart contract)\n - distribute assets(Ethereum tokens) to INVESTORs\nAn INVESTOR can:\n - be on-boarded on the platform after receipt of ISSUER's invitation\n - receive assets(Ethereum tokens) distributed by ISSUER\n - ask for more assets by submitting a subscription order\nSelf signup on the platform allows to access the ISSUER platform.\nIt is assumed the ISSUER is not malicious.\nParticular attention is paid to make sure an INVESTOR is not malicious, e.g. can not:\n - access platform without being on-boarded\n - access ISSUER features, e.g. create assets for himself\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, malicious behaviours by ISSUERS are out of scope (issuers are generally considered trustworthy and we are not concerned by their behaviour).\n",

          "instruction": "Topcoder's Work Manager application supports the set-up, launch, and management for all challenges and/or tasks created for a project.\nA client’s journey with Topcoder starts by creating a project in connect.topcoder.com (+New Project > Select option from catalog and completes intake), our project management application. The core processes that must be enabled in the project prior to work starting for the project, are:\n-The project is moved to ‘Active’ status.\n-Any project stakeholders are invited to the project and accept the invitation, so that they have visibility to the project. Outside of Topcoder employees, all other platform users can only view a project if they created it or were invited to it.\nWhen delivery is ready to start for the project, this is where the Work Manager application (challenges.topcoder.com) comes into play. At Topcoder, a project is broken down into a series of challenges or tasks for delivery. The breakdown of work options are as follows:\nTrack: Design, Development, Quality Assurance, Data Science\nType: Challenge (open competition on larger/more complex item), First2Finish Task (open competition on smaller/less complex task), Assigned Task (no competition small task)\nAfter selecting the parameters above, the user will complete the remaining set-up for the challenge or task:\n-Optional: Copilot (freelancer delivery facilitator) selection. The only Copilot options shown here should be the same Copilot(s) that were invited to the project.\n-Required: Reviewer - Community, or Internal.\n-Required: Public Specification (would be viewable to the Topcoder freelancer)\n-Required: Tags (technology attributes)\n-Required: Prize(s) (can be $0.00)\nSubmit or Save\nWork Manager is still an in-development application, so some supporting functions for challenge/task set-up such as timeline management, billing account assignment, and after set-up maintenance, will still be managed in the legacy challenge/task management system (Direct) as we work to support this functionality in the new Work Manager application. Additionally, the submission review process (submissions generated by the freelancer) will continue to operate in the Online Review application.",

The wallet application is a primary way end users will create accounts (key pairs), and interact with networks to submit transactions and read their account history.\n\nThe wallet is written as a VueJS[https://github.com/vuejs] application and packaged as an electron[https://github.com/electron] application so it can run on both Windows and OSX operating systems.  During our current development and testing phase we will be producing regular updates and builds about once every week on average.\n\nThe application leverages the official SDK for network communication, transaction creation, and private key wallets encryption. [(https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-sdk-typescript-javascript) symbol-sdk-typescript-javascript].\n\nBugs and known issues identified by the teams can be found in the repository issues [https://github.com/nemfoundation/symbol-desktop-wallet/issues]. \n\n## Setup\n\nThere are a few basic setup steps to get going with your testing set up\n\n### Download & Install\n\nFrom the releases page install (or update) to the latest version:\n\nhttps://github.com/nemfoundation/symbol-desktop-wallet/releases\n\n### Create an initial account\n\nAfter installing and first launch you will be required to create an initial account.  The wallet uses BIP32 and a mnemonic phrase approach by default to generating unique key pairs for your account.  If you are not familiar with BIP32 or mnemonic phrases do not worry, the wallet will take you through the setup steps.\n\nNOTE: for all testing as part of this scope you will use the TEST_NET “network type”.  The wallet is pre-setup to connect to our running test network so once your account is created you will not have to worry about connecting to specific nodes in the network.\n\n### Get tokens from the faucet\n\nAfter your account is set up and you are in the wallet you will need to acquire some base token funds in order to make various test transactions via the wallet.  We have two “faucets” set up for your usage:\n\nhttp://faucet-01.symboldev.network/\nhttp://faucet-02.symboldev.network/\n\nThey are both the same, two are run in case at any given time one is down we have a back up waiting for you.  You can enter our generated account address and enter the amount of funds to receive.\n\n### Application features:\n\n#### Account login and import\n\n* Login page\n  * HD wallet creation / import from mnemonic passphrase\n* Wallet page\n  * Seed wallets creation (up to 10)\n  * Private key wallet import / export\n  * Mnemonic passphrase export\n* [Transfer features] (https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/transfer-transaction.html)\n  * Send to an alias\n  * Send several mosaics at one time\n  * Send messages\n  * Initiate multi signature transfers\n* [Mosaics features] (https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/mosaic.html)\n  * Create mosaics\n  * Update mosaics supply (when applicable)\n  * Bind / Unbind aliases to mosaics\n* [Namespaces features] (https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/namespace.html)\n  * Create namespaces and sub namespaces\n  * Bind / Unbind namespaces to addresses and mosaics\n* [Multisignature features] (https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/multisig-account.html)\n  * Convert accounts to multisig accounts\n  * Edit the rules of existing multisig accounts\n  * Co-sign multisig transactions\n* News\n  * View of https://nemflash.io/ RSS feed\n\n## Out of scope features\n\nThe following features are currently out of scope:\n\n*  Hardware wallet features (Trezor, Ledger)\n*  Crypto market features\n*  Offline settings\n* Any items related to the `__tests__` and `__mocks__` directories which are used for testing and development\n\n",
